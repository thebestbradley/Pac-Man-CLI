## Implementation approach

We will use the Pygame library to develop the game. Pygame is a popular open-source library for game development in Python. It provides a simple way to create games with graphics and sound. We will also use the Click library to create the command-line interface. Click is a Python package for creating command-line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as necessary. We will follow PEP8 standards for code style and formatting.

## Python package name

cli_game

## File list

- main.py
- game.py
- food.py
- player.py

## Data structures and interface definitions

        class Game{

            -int width
            -int height
            -Player player
            -Food food
            -bool paused
            +__init__(self, width: int, height: int)
            +start_game(self)
            +pause_game(self)
            +resume_game(self)
            +restart_game(self)
            +end_game(self)
        }
        class Player{
            -int x
            -int y
            -int dx
            -int dy
            +__init__(self, x: int, y: int)
            +move(self, dx: int, dy: int)
            +collide(self, other)
        }
        class Food{
            -int x
            -int y
            +__init__(self, x: int, y: int)
            +draw(self, surface)
        }
        Game "1" -- "1" Player: has
        Game "1" -- "1" Food: has
    

## Program call flow


    sequenceDiagram
        participant M as Main
        participant G as Game
        participant P as Player
        participant F as Food
        M->>G: start game
        G->>P: move player
        G->>F: draw food
        P->>P: collide with food
        G->>G: update score
        G->>M: display score
        G->>G: check game over
        G->>M: display game over
        M->>G: pause game
        G->>G: pause game
        M->>G: resume game
        G->>G: resume game
        M->>G: restart game
        G->>G: restart game
        M->>G: end game
        G->>G: end game
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirements are clear to me.
